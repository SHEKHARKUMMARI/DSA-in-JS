Problem 1: 
A distinct string is a string that is present only once in an array.

Given an array of strings arr, and an integer k, return the kth distinct string present in arr. If there are fewer than k distinct strings, return an empty string "".

Note that the strings are considered in the order in which they appear in the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: arr = ["d","b","c","b","c","a"], k = 2
Output: "a"
Explanation:
The only distinct strings in arr are "d" and "a".
"d" appears 1st, so it is the 1st distinct string.
"a" appears 2nd, so it is the 2nd distinct string.
Since k == 2, "a" is returned. 
Example 2:

Input: arr = ["aaa","aa","a"], k = 1
Output: "aaa"
Explanation:
All strings in arr are distinct, so the 1st string "aaa" is returned.

Problem 2:
Given a multi-dimensional array arr and a depth n, return a flattened version of that array.

A multi-dimensional array is a recursive data structure that contains integers or other multi-dimensional arrays.

A flattened array is a version of that array with some or all of the sub-arrays removed and replaced with the actual elements in that sub-array. This flattening operation should only be done if the current depth of nesting is less than n. The depth of the elements in the first array are considered to be 0.

Please solve it without the built-in Array.flat method.

 

Example 1:

Input
arr = [1, 2, 3, [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, [9, 10, 11], 12], [13, 14, 15]]
n = 0
Output
[1, 2, 3, [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, [9, 10, 11], 12], [13, 14, 15]]

Explanation
Passing a depth of n=0 will always result in the original array. This is because the smallest possible depth of a subarray (0) is not less than n=0. Thus, no subarray should be flattened. 
Example 2:

Input
arr = [1, 2, 3, [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, [9, 10, 11], 12], [13, 14, 15]]
n = 1
Output
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, [9, 10, 11], 12, 13, 14, 15]



Problem 3:

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
